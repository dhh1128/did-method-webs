## Security Considerations
There are many security considerations related to web requests, storing information securely, etc. It is useful to address these considerations along with the common security threats found on the web. 

### Common security threats

`did:webs` strives to narrow the attack surface against common threats, such as:
- Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
- Denial of service (DoS) attack
- Deletion attack
- Duplicity detection
- Eclipse attack
- Forgery
- Impersonation attack
- Key Compromise attack
- Malleability attack
- Replay attack

### Using HTTPS
Perfect protection from eavesdropping is not possible with HTTPS, for various
reasons. However, URLs of DID documents and [[ref: KERI event streams]]
SHOULD be hosted in a way that embodies accepted
cybersecurity best practice. This is not strictly necessary to guarantee the
authenticity of the data. However, it safeguards privacy, discourages denial of
service, accords with a defense-in-depth mindset, aids regulatory compliance,
and makes it easier to troubleshoot. How a URL is hosted should let clients
fetch a DID document and a [[ref: KERI event stream]] with roughly the same confidence that's associated
with properly implemented online banking.

The fully qualified domain name of the [[ref: method-specific identifier]] is
secured by a TLS/SSL certificate. The fully qualified domain name MUST match the common name used
in the SSL/TLS certificate.

The common name in the SSL/TLS certificate from the server MUST correspond to
the way the server is referenced in the URL. This means that if the URL includes
`www.example.com`, the common name in the SSL/TLS certificate must be
`www.example.com` as well. Unlike `did:web`, the URL MAY use an IP address
instead. If it does, then the common name in the certificate must be the IP
address as well. Essentially, the URL and the certificate MUST NOT identify the
server in contradictory ways; subject to that constraint, how the server is
identified is flexible.

The server certificate MAY be self-issued, or it MAY chain back to an unknown
certificate authority. However, to ensure reasonable security hygiene, it MUST
be valid. This has two meanings, both of which are required:

*   The certificate MUST satisfy whatever requirements are active in the client,
    such that the client does accept the certificate and use it to build and
    communicate over the encrypted HTTPS session where a DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]] are
    fetched.
*   The certificate MUST pass some common-sense validity tests, even if the
    client is very permissive: It MUST have a valid signature, it MUST NOT be
    expired or revoked or deny-listed, and it MUST NOT have any broken links in
    its chain of trust.

If a URL of a DID document or [[ref: KERI event streams]] results in a redirect, each URL MUST satisfy the same security
requirements. A URL MAY come from a URL shortener.

### Concepts for securing `did:webs` information

The following security concepts are used to secure the data, files, signatures and other information in `did:webs`. We characterize each concept with high, medium and low security to orient readers to the situational relevance.
We use _KEL backed data_ security for the highest possible security of on-disk storage, but it is also the most costly because it uses space in KELs. _Best Available Data - Read, Update, Nullify_ ([[ref: BADA-RUN]]) is medium security and makes sure events are ordered in a consistent way, using a combination of date-time and a key state. Without having to negotiate security in did:webs we use a lower level of security, _KERI Request Authentication Mechanism_ ([[ref: KRAM]]), when appropriate. 

#### KEL backed data: High Security

[[ref: KEL]] backed information in `did:webs` can either be found in the KEL or found anchored to the KEL. This means the signatures on the events in the KEL are strongly bound to the key state at the time the events are entered in the KEL. This provides the strongest guarantee of duplicity evidence so that any verifier is protected. The information is end-verifiable and any evidence of duplicity means do-not-trust. A key compromise of a stale key can not result in an exploit because that would require forging an alternate version of the KEL which would be exposed as duplicity. Key compromise of the current key state is recoverable with a rotation to the pre-rotated key(s) (single-sig or multi-sig). By design, pre-rotated keys are post-quantum proof. A compromise of a current key state is guaranteed to be detectable by the AID’s controller because the compromise requires publication of a new KEL event in infrastructure (i.e. witnesses) controlled by the AID controller. This limits the exposure of a successful compromise of the current key state to the time it takes for the AID controller to observe the compromised publication and execute a recovery rotation. 

The ordering of events in the KEL is strictly verifiable because the KEL is a hash chain (block chain). All events are end-verifiable. Any data anchored to these events is also end-verifiable. All of these properties are guaranteed when data is anchored to a KEL, i.e., [[ref: KEL]] backed. Any information that wants to be end-verifiably authentic over time should be at this highest level of security. [[ref: ACDCs]], when anchored to a KEL directly or indirectly through a [[ref: TEL]] that itself is anchored to a KEL, have this level of security.

#### BADA-RUN: Medium Security

[[ref: BADA-RUN]] stands for Best available data acceptance - Read/Update/Nullify and is described in the ToIP KERI [[ref: OOBI specification]]. It makes sure events are ordered in a consistent way, using a combination of date-time and a key state.

The latest event is the one with the latest date-time for the latest key state. This level of security is sufficient for discovery information because the worst-case attack on discovery information is a DDoS attack where nothing gets discovered. This is because what gets discovered in KERI must be end-verifiable (anchored to a KEL). So a malicious discovery (mal-discovery) is no different than a mis-discovery or a non-discovery. The mitigation for such a DDoS attack is to have redundant discovery sources. We use [[ref: BADA-RUN]] for service end-points as discovery mechanisms. 

BADA policy provides guarantees that the latest data-state cannot be compromised via a replay of an earlier data-state where early is determined by the monotonicity of the associated (date-time, key state) tuple. It also protects against forgery of new data-state given the compromise of any state key state. It does not protect against the forgery of new data-state, given a compromise of the _current_ key state. It does not provide ordering of all data-states but ensures that the data-state _last seen_ by a given verifier cannot be replaced with an earlier data-state without compromising either the latest key state of the source or by compromising the storage of the verifier.

The difference between BADA and KEL backing is that with [[ref: KEL]] backed update a compromise of the current key state is always detectable because the attacker must publish a new event to the KEL on infrastructure (such as witnesses) controlled by the AID’s legitimate controller. Whereas with BADA there is no mechanism that guarantees the AID’s legitimate controller can detect that its current key has been compromised.

One way to mitigate this exploit (non-detectability of current key state compromise) is to periodically KEL anchor a batch of BADA signed data. This then imposes a maximum time for exploit of the current signing key state. Any BADA verified data that is the latest seen data by a verifier but whose time stamp is older than the current batch time period window could then be reverified against the batch anchor for its appropriate time window. If that data is not included in its time window’s batch anchor then this could be flagged by the verifier as likely duplicitous data and the verifier would not trust and could re-request an update from the AID controller. This is a hybrid of KEL backed and [[ref: BADA-RUN]] security.

To elaborate, because BADA only protects that latest data-state it is only appropriate for data where only the latest data-state is important. Unlike token based systems, however, BADA does not invalidate all latest data-states every time the key state is updated (rotated) where such invalidation would thereby force a refresh of all latest data-states. This property of not forcing auto-invalidation upon key rotation makes BADA suitable for asynchronous broadcast or gossip of the latest data-state in support of an authenticatable distributed data base. That means that it is not useful for verifiable credentials or similar applications that must have verifiable provenance of old data-states. For example when old data-states must still be valid such as a credential issued under a now stale key state that must still be valid unless explicitly revoked.

Albeit weaker than KEL backing, BADA is a significant performance and security improvement over token based systems. It also has performance advantages over KEL backing. As a result BADA is approapriate for information that does not benefit from verifiable ordering of all data-states but only the latest data-state such as a distributed data-base.

In [[ref: BADA-RUN]], the RUN stands for Read, Update, Nullify and is a replacement for CRUD in an API. CRUD does not protect from replay attacks on the data-state because a delete erases any record of last seen which destroys the monotonicity of the (date-time, key state) tuple. Likewise Create makes no sense because the API host cannot create a record only the remote client can. Moreover, the function of a secure BADA Update must account for both first seen and last seen so a Create verb would be entirely superflous. Nullify deactivates a record without losing the monotonicy of update guarantee. RUN provides the appropriate verbs for any API that applies the security guarantees of a BADA policy to the data-state of its records.

#### KRAM: Low Security

KERI Request Authentication Mechanism ([[ref: KRAM]]) is the lowest security requirement and can only be used for ephemeral query/reply mechanisms that protect against replay attacks and key-compromise attacks at the moment, not over time. This is done with [[ref: KRAM]], which is a non-interactive replay attack protection algorithm that uses a sliding window of date-time stamps and key state (similar to the the tuple as in [[ref: BADA-RUN]]) but the date-time is the replier’s not the querier’s. **[[ref: KRAM]] is meant to protect a host** when providing access to information to a client from replay attacks by a malicious client. It is not meant to protect the information provided by the host. For that we must use [[ref: BADA-RUN]] or KEL backing. Thus, by itself [[ref: KRAM]] is not suitable to protect on-disk storage (see [[ref: On-Disk Storage]] section below).

The `did:webs` resolver should be using KRAM to access the service endpoints providing KERI event streams for verification of the DID document. This is part of what makes the local resolver trusted, and it must control who has access and KRAM provides the necessary “non-interactive” basis for non-replay attackable access.

### On-Disk Storage

Both KEL backed data and [[ref: BADA-RUN]] security approaches are suitable for storing information on disk because both provide a link between the keystate and date-time on some data when a signature by the source of the data was created. [[ref: BADA-RUN]] is too weak for important information because an attacker who has access to the database on disk can overwrite data on disk without being detected by a verifier hosting the on-disk data either through a replay of stale data (data regression attack) or if in addition to disk access the attacker has compromised a given key state, then the attacker can forge new data with a new date-time stamp for a given compromised key and do a regression attack so that the last seen key state is the compromised key state.

With BADA, protection from a deletion (regression) attack requires redundant disk storage. At any point in time where there is a suspicion of loss of custody of the disk, a comparison to the redundant disks is made and if any disk has a later event given [[ref: BADA-RUN]] rules then recovery from the deletion attack is possible.

[[ref: KRAM]] on a query is not usable for on disk storage by itself. Because it's just a bare signature (the datetime is not of the querier but of the host at the time of a query). However, the reply to a query can be stored on disk if the querier applies BADA to the reply. To elaborate, Data obtained via a KRAMed query-reply may be protected on-disk by being using BADA on the reply. This is how KERI stores service endpoints. However, KERI currently only uses BADA for discovery data not more important data. More important data should be wrapped (containerized) in an [[ref: ACDC]] that is [[ref: KEL]] backed and then stored on-disk

In the hierarchy of attack surfaces, exposure as on disk (unencrypted) is the weakest. Much stronger is exposure that is only in-memory. To attack in-memory usually means compromising the code supply chain which is harder than merely gaining disk access. Encrypting data on disk does not necessarily solve attacks that require a key compromise (because decryption keys can be compromised), and it does not prevent a deletion attack. Encryption does not provide authentication protection. However, encryption does protect the confidentiality of data.

The use of DH key exchange as a weak form of authentication is no more secure than an HMAC for authentication. It is sharing secrets, so anyone with the secret can impersonate any other member of the group that has the shared secret.

Often, DID methods have focused on features that erode security characteristics. The paper [Five DID Attacks](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/final-documents/taking-out-the-crud-five-fabulous-did-attacks.pdf) highlights some attacks to which `did:webs` should NOT be vulnerable. So when a pull request exposes `did:webs` to a known attack, it should not be accepted.

### Alignment of Information to Security Posture

As a general security principle each block of information should have the same security posture for all the sub-blocks. One should not attempt to secure a block of information that mixes security postures across is constituent sub-blocks. The reason is that the security of the block can be no stronger than the weakest security posture of any sub-block in the block. Mixing security postures forces all to have the lowest common denominator security. The only exception to this rule is if the block of information is purely informational for discovery purposes and where it is expected that each constituent sub-block is meant to be verified independently.

This means that any recipient of such a block information with mixed security postures across its constituent sub-blocks must explode the block into sub-blocks and then independently verify the security of each sub-block. However, this is only possible if the authentication factors for each sub-block are provided independently. Usually when information is provided in a block of sub-blocks, only one set of authentication factors are provided for the block as a whole and therefore there is no way to independently verify each sub-block of information.

Unfortunately, what happens in practice is that users are led into a false sense of security because they assume that they don’t have to explode and re-verify, but merely may accept the lowest common denominator verification on the whole block of information. This creates a pernicious problem for downstream use of the data. A downstream use of a constituent sub-block doesn’t know that it was not independently verified to its higher level of security. This widens the attack surface to any point of down-stream usage. This is a root cause of the most prevalent type of attack called a BOLA.

#### Applying the concepts

Lets explore the implications of applying these concepts to various `did:webs` elements.

Using [[ref: KEL]] backed elements in a DID doc simplifies the security concerns. However, future discovery features related to endpoints might consider BADA-RUN. For instance, 'whois' data could be used with [[ref: BADA-RUN]] whereas did:web aliases should not because it could lead to an impersonation attack. We could have a DID document that uses [[ref: BADA-RUN]] if we modify the DID CRUD semantics to be RUN semantics without necessarily changing the verbs but by changing the semantics of the verbs. Then any data that fits the security policy of BADA (i.e. where BADA is secure enough) can be stored in a DID document as a database in the sky. For sure this includes service endpoints for discovery. One can sign with CESR or JWS signatures. The payloads are essentially KERI reply messages in terms of the fields (with modifications as needed to be more palatable), but are semantically the same. The DID doc just relays those replies. Anyone reading from the DID document is essentially getting a KERI reply message, and they then should apply the BADA rules to their local copy of the reply message.

To elaborate, these security concepts point us to modify the DID CRUD semantics to replicate RUN semantics. _Create_ becomes synonymous with _Update_ where Update uses the RUN update. _Delete_ is modified to use the Nullify semantics. _Read_ data is modified so that any recipient of the Read response can apply BADA to its data (Read is a GET). So we map the CRUD of DID docs to RUN for the `did:webs` method. Now you have reasonable security for things like signed data. If its [[ref: KEL]] backed data you could even use an ACDC as a data attestation for that data and the did resolver would become a caching store for ACDCs issued by the AID controller.

Architecturally, a Read (GET) from the did resolver acts like how KERI reply messages are handled for resolving service endpoint discovery from an [[ref: OOBI]]. The query is the read in RUN and so uses KRAM. The reply is the response to the READ request. The controller of the AID updates the DID resolvers cache with updates(unsolicited reply messages). A trustworthy DID resolver applies the BADA rules to any updates it receives. Optionally the DID resolver may apply [[ref: KRAM]] rules to any READ requests to protect it from replay attacks.

In addition, a DID doc can be a discovery mechanism for an ACDC caching server by including an index (label: said) of the SAIDs of the ACDCs held in the resolvers cache.

#### Narrowing the attack surface

The above considerations have lead us to focus on [[ref: KEL]] backed DID document blocks and data (whois files, signatures, etc) so that the trusted (local) did:webs resolver is secure. Any future features that could leverage [[ref: BADA-RUN]] and [[ref: KRAM]] should be considered carefully according to the above considerations.
