## Interoperability Profiles
The following interoperability profiles define the requirements necessary for a did:webs implementation and the did:webs identifiers that use that implementation to interoperate with other did:webs identifiers. The profiles will also help to fascilate an automated test suite for did:webs implementations to validate their interoperability profile achievement. 

### Minimal interoperability profile
This profile defines the absolute minimal implementation to create and interoperate with a did:webs identifier.
