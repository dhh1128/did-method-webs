### Terminology

[[def: authentic chained data container (ACDC), ACDC, ACDCs]]
~ a variant of [the Verifiable Credential (VC) specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) that inherits the security model derived from [[ref: KERI]], as defined by the [draft ACDC specification](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html). See [WebOfTrust glossary](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/authentic-chained-data-container) for more detail.

[[def: autonomic identifier (AID), AID, AIDs]]
~ A [[ref: DID]] that is self-certifying and cryptographically bound to a [[ref: key event log]] ([[ref: KEL]]), as defined by the [draft KERI specification](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/draft-ssmith-keri.html#name-autonomic-identifier-aid). An AID is either non-transferable or transferable. A non-transferable AID does not support key rotation while a transferable AID supports key rotation using a key [[ref: pre-rotation]] mechanism that enables the AID to persist in spite of the evolution of its key state. See [WebOfTrust glossary](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/autonomic-identifier) for more detail.

[[def: compact event streaming representation (CESR), CESR]]
~ An encoding format that enables round-trip text-binary conversion of concatenated cryptographic primitives and general data types, as defined by the [draft CESR specification](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/draft-ssmith-cesr.html) and [draft CESR Proof Signature specification](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-proof-specification/draft-pfeairheller-cesr-proof.html).  See [WebOfTrust glossary](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/composable-event-streaming-representation) for more detail.

[[def: controller, constrollers]]
~ A controlling entity that can cryptographically prove the control authority (signing and rotation) over an [[ref: AID]] as well as make changes on the associated [[ref: KEL]]. A controller may consist of multiple controlling entities in a multi-signature scheme. See [WebOfTrust glossary](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/controller) for more detail.

[[def: decentralized identifier (DID), DID, DIDs]]

[[def: interaction event, interaction events]]
~ A key event that anchors external data to an [[ref: AID]], as defined by the [draft KERI specification](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/draft-ssmith-keri.html#section-2).
